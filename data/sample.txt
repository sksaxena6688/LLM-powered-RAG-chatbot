RAG Chatbot Sample Document

What is RAG?
RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique that combines information retrieval with language model generation to produce more accurate and grounded responses.

How does RAG work?
1. Documents are split into chunks
2. Each chunk is converted into a vector embedding
3. Embeddings are stored in a vector database
4. When a user asks a question, it is also converted to an embedding
5. The most similar document chunks are retrieved
6. These chunks are provided as context to the language model
7. The model generates an answer based only on the provided context

Benefits of RAG
- Reduces hallucination by grounding answers in source documents
- Allows updating knowledge without retraining the model
- Provides source attribution for answers
- Works with private or proprietary documents

Components of a RAG System
- Document Loader: Ingests PDF, text, or other document formats
- Text Splitter: Breaks documents into manageable chunks
- Embedding Model: Converts text to vector representations
- Vector Store: Efficiently stores and retrieves embeddings
- Language Model: Generates natural language responses
- Retriever: Finds relevant chunks based on similarity

This sample document demonstrates how RAG can answer questions about itself.
